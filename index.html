      <p class="content">The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is an award for achievement in the rock music industry, dedicated to those in history who have influenced the music industry as a whole in their own way. According to John Sykes, the Chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, â€œThese artists have created their own sounds that have impacted generations and influenced countless others that have followed in their footsteps."In 2022, the news that the American rapper Eminem was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame created buzz among the music fans, some argued that Eminem's music has nothing to do with rock&roll, which inspired me to think about the what was implied in rock music.</p>
      <p class="content">Every musical genre consists of a set of beliefs about music itself, but also about the people who make and listen to that music, about the experiences it's imagined to connote and the functions it's imagined to serve. Rock&roll, in particular, has meant a lot of different things at a lot of different times to a lot of different people, and even the phrase itself well predates the vast range of sounds it would come to describe. Obviously, at present, the word ROCK has far more meanings then when it was firstly defined, it's the representation of showing your own attitude and taking courage to resist the world. Those artists who are inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, no matter they are play folk songs or blues, are bursting with rock&roll energy and a huge influence on the spirit of rock&roll</p>   
      <p class="content">Therefore, I scraped the information about other genres from the Wikipedia page of Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, including soul, rap, pop and so on, trying to find some connections among them and the remarkable effect that other genres have on the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.</p>
